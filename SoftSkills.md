# Soft Skills
Soft skills are skills that are connected to our personality like social and communication skills. These skills are usually not connected directly to our tasks or requerments, but have a role in the quality of our work that we do every day. That is why more and more companies try to pick people with skills just like these, especially in the IT industry. Working well in a team, good communication with a client or a flawless presentation to a product can make a huge difference in a company. 
## Presentation skills
Presentation skills in simple terms would be the ability to present a product, idea or process to an audience successfully. These skills consist of the skill to make the slides, presentation or the project that you need to present and the skills to communicate the idea or project to the audience. The second part can be a little tricky and most people just focus on the presentation slides, but it totally misses the main idea of a presentation. The audience needs to understand the idea or product, not just see a presentation. To have a successful presentation there are some things that you need to know:
* Face the audience when you are presenting
* Talk loud and clear
* Make pauses after important statements
* Don't just read the presentation
* Remember that the presentation slides are not the main goal of the presentation
* Talk slowly
* Look for feedback from the audience
* Most of the audience understands that it is hard to hold a presentation
