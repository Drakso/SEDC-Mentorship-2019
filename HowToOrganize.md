# How to organize while developing an application

Organizing and management is a very important part in building a project. This is true for every person that tries to build a project from a scratch, and especially true for teams of multiple people. First you need to organize the tasks that you have and see which tasks are part of the foundation of your application, the tasks that represent the start. This usually means creating a blank page, create a system for calling an API, system for receiving calls from an API or a server. A simple API call or an HTML page can be a good start to an application. Tracking the priority on the tasks is also important. We don't want to start by doing tasks that have low priority like designing a button or adding contact email form. This is why there should be an MVP of the project.
#### MVP
An MVP - Minimum Viable Product is the minimum bare-bones version of your project that actually does what you intended to do. If you are making a time tracker, you will build a simple tracker in the console. That is a minimum viable product. It is a tracker, it tracks time, it works, it does what the project was intended. From there you try and show it in the HTML, then Design it to look better and so on. So the milestones of your project will look something like this:
1. First milestone - Create an MVP that does what it suppose to do, that works
2. Second milestone - Create something that works and that is also usable 
3. Third milestone - Create something that works, it's usable and also looks pretty

#### Project Management and Task Tracking Tools
Project management and task tracking tools can help you organize your tasks easily in a team or alone. These tools usually have systems for tracking tasks, priority, time, sub-tasks and notes. We go to a tool like this, add our tasks in the planning phase and then as we work we get some tasks and set their status from initial to working. After we finish them we put them in done. This way we can visually see where we are at the project and how many things do we need to do to finish our project or get to some milestone. Some tools for project management are:
