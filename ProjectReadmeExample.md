# Solaris üõ∞
## About the project ‚≠ê
This project was part of the SEDC assignment for building a project independently as students. This assignment was meant to teach students to build something from scratch and experience working on a real world project. The ideas are independent and are not given before hand, but defined by the student it self. 

## Idea ‚òÑ
Solaris is an educational project. It strives to educate people about solar energy, what plans could they choose if they decided to go green and also help them calculate how much solar panels would they need for a certain amount of electricity. The project goal is to spread awareness that solar energy is cheaper than ever and pretty effective. This is done by illustrating solutions and statistics about solar energy. It can also be achieved by the solar panel calculator that is configurable and can give approximate values of how much power would a person get if they were to buy some solar panels.
