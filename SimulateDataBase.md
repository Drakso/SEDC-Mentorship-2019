# How to simulate a Data Base with JSON  ðŸ“¦
Don't have an API for the project you want to build? Well no worries. There is no reason not to realize your idea just because you don't have a publicly available API. The project is based on how good the idea is. To show off an idea, a system and some features you don't always need live data. You can easily create the whole project with some DUMMY data. This DUMMY data will be a representation of a real data should your product is deemed successful or a good investment. You can implement this DUMMY data by writing it all in a JSON or multiple JSON files and uploading them to github. After uploading them you can make AJAX calls to that JSON RAW link and get the json data to your project that way.  This will simulate a SERVER and DATA on it, so you can realize and finish your project and show off your idea. So to recap:
1. Create a JSON file with your own data
2. Upload it to GitHub
3. Go to the JSON file on GitHub
4. Click RAW
5. Copy the Link
6. Make AJAX Call to the Link
7. Get the JSON and Parse it
8. ENJOY YOUR DATA
